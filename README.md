<p align="center">Performing Analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.</p>

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to compare how different fundraising campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Louise's play _Fever_ came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Using the dataset that I cleaned up I was able to create different tables and graphs to compare the campaigns.


## Analysis and Challenges
I performed my analysis by creating different types of charts and statistical tables to compare and contrast the the dataset.By looking at the chart below we can see in terms of average amount of fundraising if the goal was 5,000 you would be successful compared to $10,554 you would fail. We also can compare the goal amount vs. the amount pledged.

**Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date**

May is the best time to launch theaters while June,July, and August are also pretty successful. The highest outcomes of failed theaters are betweeen May-August and October.


**Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals**

After analyzing the images/tables above you can see that a higher fundraising goal does not achieve high success, in contrast a lower fundraising goal leads to more success. As the fundraising goal increases the percentage failed increases as well.

**Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**

Being able to clean up the data was a challenge I encountered. With such a massive dataset it is very important to clean up the data. Once I was creating new columns I was getting errors because some values were incorrect. This is something I need to keep improving at.




## Results
**What are two conclusions you can draw Outcomes based on Launch Date?**

May is by far the best month in terms of successful theaters. After May the number of successful theaters keeps decreasing at a higher rate until there is a small increase in October but then drops again in November/December. The highest outcomes of failed theaters are between May-August and October. Overall May has the biggest difference between successful and failed theaters. Canceled theaters stayed consistent over the year except in October where there was none.

**What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**

As we can see in the graph below the higher amount in our goal correlated with a higher percentage of failure. Meanwhile a less than 1000 for our goal correlated with almost an 80% percentage successful. There are also multiple points of intersection meaning that there was a 50/50 chance in terms of success and failure depending on the goal.

**What are some limitations of this dataset?**

This dataset does not tell us how much was pledged. For example 1000 to 4999 goal had the second highest percentage rate with 73% but we do not know how much money was pledged. Out of 534 projects for that goal 146 failed but again we do not know if they were close to that 1000 goal or not.

**What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**

Another graph that would give us a good idea a bar graph between the fundraising goal and country. I would also include the type of category in this chart. There may be a correlation between category, country and the fundraising goal. I would also like to see a table between duration of the fundraising and outcome. Do longer fundraisers correlate with more success or does it not matter?
